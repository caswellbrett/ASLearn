# ASLearn

##### Created by [Daven Froberg](https://github.com/davenfroberg) and [Brett Caswell](https://github.com/caswellbrett)

ASLearn is an ASL (American Sign Language) Learning platform which uses the user's webcam to detect their hand position and interpret it into different ASL letters and numbers.

This was a collaborative project which we submitted for our nwPlus HackCamp 2023 hackathon submission. ASLearn was one of five winners out of 57 projects submitted. The theme for the hackathon was "inclusivity, diversity, and accessibility." We created this project from scratch in under 12 hours (including learning Django and other python libraries) and are hoping to improve it in the coming future!
